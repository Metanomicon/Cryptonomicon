# Summary

A [Nomicon](https://cryptotechguru.github.io/Cryptonomicon/Nomicon) is a governance game predicated on the notion that `Policy Is Code`. The implication of that axiom is that policy is amenable to software development processes like version control, issue tracking, task management, critical review, and continuous integration.

A [Meridion](Meridion.md) project is a Nomicon game wrapped around a git project to enhance the development process.
